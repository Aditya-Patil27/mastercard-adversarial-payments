/**
 * The overview.
 *
 * Structurally this borrows the shape every enterprise fraud platform uses -- dark hero,
 * statistics band, capability cards, close -- because a wall of white reads as a document
 * rather than a system. What it deliberately does not borrow is the half of that page
 * which is social proof: logo carousels, testimonials, award strips. This is a three-day
 * build with no customers, and every one of those would have to be invented.
 *
 * A judging panel scans for what/why/impressive in the first ten seconds, so the argument
 * is a three-step flow before it is a paragraph, and every raw metric carries its own
 * translation -- "3.81 -> 4.64 mean features touched" means nothing to a reader who does
 * not already know what L0 is.
